## About The Project

[!\\\[Product Name Screen Shot\\\]\\\[product-screenshot\\\]](https://github.com/t-jones14/Arduino-Nextion-PC-System-Control-Panel/)

This project started when I decided to build a computer. Having never built one before, I decided to go all-out (kind of). I wanted it to be unique and highlight my abilities. Throughout the design and construction phase I entirely neglected to incorporate any system controls and decided to get creative. To stick with the "exposed" theme of the build the idea to incorporate a raw, yet-modern approach was born.

### Built With

* Arduino Nano V3.0 (Elegoo Nano V3.0+) w/ ATmega328P: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TTN2HMQ">Amazon</a>
* Nextion Enhanced 3.5" HMI Resistive Touchscreen: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08535V3KW">Amazon</a>

## Getting Started

Overall, this project is rather simple... If you're somewhat semi-technically inclined.
